# Introduction:
- Region is a location - Sydney, Capetown, Mumbai etc. Each Region contains 2 or more AZs.
- Availability Zone is like a datacenter - Hitech Campus Eindhoven. This can be more than one datacenter. Each AZ in a region are like 100Kms from each other.
- Edge Location - Endpoints for caching like CloudFront (CDN). More than 200 edge locations.

# Summary
S3
- Is a storage service with high durability and availability and can hold files/objects and host a static website, serve as an archive of data.
- Various storage classes exist that have varying cost implications.
- Different storage classes have different replication behavior.
- Can encrypt data using security keys.
- Lifecycle policy helps in moving data between storage classes, purging after a certain threshold etc.
- Replication policy helps in copying the data to a different location / region to help in minimising the access times.
- Individual objects within the S3 bucket can be shared for public access while the bucket itself is private.

- [Hosting a Static Website](#hosting-a-static-website-in-aws)
- [Bucket Versioning](#s3-versioning)
- [Bucket Replication](#s3-bucket-replication)


Lambda
- [Hosting a Lambda function to determine if a Web Page is Up or Not](#hosting-a-lambda-function-that-tells-whether-a-web-page-is-up-or-not)


# S3
- S3 is object based storages - Image, text, webpage. So can't be used as a database.
- Unlimited storage. Object max size is 5TB.
- S3 buckets are like folders in S3 - Finance, HR etc, but need to have Universal Unique space.
- Object vs Block Storage
  - Object storage is useful for data that does not change often. Write-once Ready-Many times usecases. Also this is compatible with distributed systems - data stored in multiple nodes.
  - Block storage is useful for holding databases/caches. Also for high intensive IO operations.
  - Searches are fast with Object storage. Big Data analytics usecases.
  - Updates with Block storage are easier as we have access to individual blocks. With object storage, this is not possible. Entire file has to be created again.
  - S3 offers Object storage. Amazon Elastic Block Storage offers Block storage solutions.
- https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/
- S3 has different storage classes that are used based on the frequency of access.

- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42272776/146680782-11e8a8f1-a325-4032-9caa-02873018633f.png)
- Selected objects can be specifically shared in an S3 bucket while the bucket itself is not shared. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42272776/146680953-97ba6781-3d8d-4d09-a5f6-993f3dc04ff8.png)

## Hosting a static website in AWS
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42272776/143780612-5294497e-e81d-41df-b878-bc8caa2896c4.png)
- Bucket Policy determines who all can use/access the bucket/its content.
- /* means making the Policy applicable to all the objects in the Bucket.
- We create an S3 bucket and upload the error.html and index.html files in it.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42272776/143780919-490da1e0-ff37-4d4c-a22f-05d0ae0b4537.png)
- We then update the policy for this bucket in its Permissions section.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42272776/143780927-5bd655fc-c9e4-4acf-8f7a-5aefbe35ad7b.png)
- We also configure the Static website hosting in bucket Properties.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42272776/143780943-bd7fba54-5e44-4afd-b00b-ebcff8f288df.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42272776/143780793-fc175b66-8ebe-4781-a2c1-e9a34e445dff.png)

## S3 Versioning
- Versioning can be configured at Bucket level so that when a file with same name is uploaded, a version gets created.
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42272776/144109147-b74bae10-32b6-4200-ae6a-23a8fc4a579c.png)
- Unlimited number of versions can be created. https://acloud.guru/forums/aws-csa-2019/discussion/-LzddK__zQps2CcoZum9/How%20many%20versions%20of%20a%20file%20can%20be%20saved%20in%20S3%3F
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42272776/144108361-71753a72-9fae-4bdb-b3d3-78b46fa94be1.png)
- Public access can be granted from the UI of AWS on the Bucket/Object. But with a Bucket Policy, better control is provided statements/principals/actions/resources.
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "unique-id-to-describe-below-statement",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "unique-sid",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::testbucket99912121/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## S3 Bucket Replication
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42272776/143920852-223d5357-00c9-4d9d-8b81-0e395fa5dac4.png)
- Create Bucket 1 and Bucket 2
- In Management of Bucket 1, create a Replication Rule with Source as Bucket 1 and Target as Bucket 2.
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42272776/143920961-555fe1ae-7fd2-489b-a64b-1d21c583e140.png)
- Any new files that are updated to AWS in Bucket 1 will now sync to Bucket 2 automatically.
- ‚ùì How to sync existing ones?.

## S3 Bucket with Versioning and Deletion Protection - Lifecycle Configuration
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42272776/146632881-a7023323-7325-4b9b-b412-559e206a72f2.png)
- Objects that are stored in S3 buckets may need to be deleted or moved to a different less costly storage after some time. Further, there may be certain objects in an S3 bucket that are to be archived. All these are configured using a Lifecycle rule.
- A note on encryption. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-encryption.html
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42272776/146633227-65ac3655-b4a1-40b3-9e78-d0004e356db0.png)

# Lambda / Serverless
## Hosting a Lambda function that tells whether a web page is up or not
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42272776/143782240-0956fddd-d006-489d-abf1-779e19bb6eb6.png)
- Execution role is like the service account that is used to run the lambda function.
- Create an AWS Lambda Function with NodeJS as the language.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42272776/143782396-0fe12395-962d-41ef-b7fa-3bd625a52d26.png)

- The logging information from a Lambda function gets routed to AWS cloud watch.
- Notice the time billed for the operation.
- Custom logging information also goes to AWS Cloud Watch - console.xxx statements.

## Deploying a SpringBoot jar file to EBS
- A simple SpringBoot application that processes GET, POST, DELETE and PUT requests onto the URI /movies.
```
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("movies")
public class RestAPIController {

    @GetMapping
    public String getUser() {
        return "Get Movies";
    }

    @PostMapping
    public String createUser() {
        return "Post Movies";
    }

    @PutMapping
    public String updateUser() {
        return "Put Movies";
    }

    @DeleteMapping

# CI/CD

## CodeStar
- AWS had a new service release in 2017, called CodeStar.
- It is a fully managed service and encapsulates the other CI/CD services.
- We have to choose a template in CodeStar and it would create the other services as shown below based on our selection.
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42272776/145706729-41e96a0e-e6bd-403e-906b-f8c313f83f54.png)
- CodeStart also provisions CodeCommit repository for the project and an update to the content in that repository triggers a CI/CD pipeline.
